### Think globally, act locally, how it all started?
In 2013 Dariusz Drezno, a Polish software testing expert, manager, lecturer, came up with the idea of the writing portal **[Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/)**. Although not the first in Europe, it became the most reliable tech comm knowledge base. What's more, the content itself is provided in the Polish native language. The language of the IT world is, in fact, English, but **[Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/)** brings together the local tech comm folks.
