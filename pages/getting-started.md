Welcome to the guide devoted to Tech Writers Community.

Such a community of practice in Poland has been formed successfully over the years. The demand for Documentation Specialists is constantly increasing. Follow the successful Polish path and become a creator of the community in your own country. 

## Think globally, act locally, how it all started?
In 2013 Dariusz Drezno, a Polish software testing expert, manager, lecturer, came up with the idea of the writing portal Techwriter.pl. Although not the first in Europe, it became the most reliable tech comm knowledge base. What's more, the content itself is provided in the Polish native language. The language of the IT world is, in fact, English, but Techwriter.pl brings together local tech comm folks.
